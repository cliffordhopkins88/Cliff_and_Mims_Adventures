    Swimming Through a Shark Attack: When the extra rest pays off!
    <p>February 2020.</p>
    <p>Yesterday I sent Swimming Through Shark Attack in El Chorro, Spain. It was my first f8a+ and was 7 years after doing my first f8a here. I can guess what your thinking: It's probably soft or I only did it because I'm tall, but this is usually the case when breaking into a new grade.</p>
     <p>The last time I did anything hard (for me) on a rope was in 2016. My recent routing escapades have been focussed on on-sighting and quick sends. I recently spent 6 weeks in the Blue Mountains and was so excited at all the new, cool looking routes, that I couldn't bring myself to try anything harder than 27(F7c), of which I didn’t even send (yet).</p> 
     <p> While, it's pretty awesome to cover so much ground, after a while I started to feel hungry for a bigger challenge.</p>   
     <p> Fast forward through a month of only indoor bouldering in Sydney, during the Australian summer, Mim and I arrive in El Chorro for the start of our 2 month Spain trip. We are feeling pretty strong and psyched, although probably a little low on endurance and lacking in rock climbing practice. </p>    
     <p>While I have spent total of 7 weeks in El Chorro on 2 separate trips 7 and 8 years ago, Mim had never been here, meaning the focus of our time here was probably to be a little different: Mim would be after some quicker ticks, but I wanted something harder I could sink my teeth into.</p>    
     <p> I remembered people trying Swimming Through a Shark Attack in Poema de Roca cave on my last visit, I never considered it would be a possibility for me. It consists of a disorientating sea of large tufas through a very steep roof. </p>   
   <p>The climb reminded me of my UK boulder project, Lou Ferrino in Parisella's cave, that I tried a lot last year. While I have not yet sent it, I realised that it had taught me a few things about squeezing things upside down in a limestone cave. </p>   
  <p> Needless to say, I was pretty excited when I saw this route again after all these years. I tied in without too much expectation and spent an hour trying to get to the chains due to the confusing nature of upside-down tufa climbing. I lowered off, pretty bloody exhausted and not sure if I wanted another go. The next go that day only felt the tiniest bit easier. Luckily someone else's draws were in it otherwise I might have sacked it off.</p>   
  <p> Three sessions later and lots of beta refinement, I had a really good burn, getting to the end crux. I suddenly realised I might be able to do this thing. At this point we had been in El Chorro for over 2 weeks and i spent a lot of time moaning about conditions and my skin. I spent my 'easier' climbing days pottering up 6a-6c in fear of being too tired to get on the project.</p>  
   <p> I decided I would have a little break from the route and try to send something that would be a challenge but that I should be able to do pretty quickly. I did Máquina Pestosa 7b+, Desplomilandia second go but that felt too easy and wasn't the confidence boost I had hoped for. The next day I decided to embark on a mega line called Sandokan 7c. Going clip to clip felt desperate on a very humid day, feeling like I had olive oil in my chalk bag. I couldn't do the sequence the usual way, as the undercut pocket was very damp, so made up a sequence going left before doing a massive move to a jug: I do love those. On my first red point my foot slipped below the crux and I had a nightmare trying to get through the Crux to retrieve the quick-draws. I was in a ‘climber with shit skin’ kind of mood: not happy.</p>   
    <p>I now had 2 routes to do, Sandokan and Shark attack and only 4 days left in El Chorro. I decided to take 2 rest days and try and do Sandokan and then return to Shark Attack on the last day. A bit of a risk but ‘he who dares wins’ or something like that.</p>  
    <p>Three days left in Chorro and I return to Sandokan and got pretty excited putting the draws in, as the air was dry and I felt nicely rested. After a serious looking German fella nearly flashes it, I feel a little silly for moaning that it's a hard 7c. I decide to pull my finger out and send it next go. I suddenly feel strong and happy for the first time in a while.</p>  
   <p>Meanwhile Mim had been making great tracks at her fast red-pointing skills, ticking the close-by 7a and 7a+, the Pod and Chayenne. After we think we’re done for the day, I suddenly have the idea that I could have a burn on Shark Attack on the way home, potentially increasing the chances of a final day send. We pack up at Desplo’ and head to Poema for the last of the light.</p>  
   <p> When we arrive I tell Mim I don't want to try just yet because I need to warm up and cool down. My face and body were warm from driving and walking in the sun, but my fingers and arms are not yet recruited. I take my shirt off, despite the cool wind and recent shade and do pull up movements in a squat position on the edge of a mini boulder, while excessively chalking up my hands, trying to dry out my finger tips.</p>  
  <p>I had probably climbed this route in my head over a hundred times. Yes, a little sad I know, but it's remarkable how much progress and beta adjustments you can do without even being at the crag. I felt much cooler now and more recruited and decided to do an active visualisation while looking at the holds. If you have seen the recent video called Silence with Ondra’s visualisation, you can laugh now. I finish my animated enactment and Mims asks if I did it. I give my jokingly cocky response of 'yeh twas piss' knowing that the real thing is another story. </p>  
  <p> Standing at the bottom, already elated that I smashed Sandokan earlier in the day, I took some large breaths, forced a big smile and set off through the sea of tufas.</p>  
  <p>Climbing a hard route that has been practiced a lot requires entering into a deep flow state. Its a strange feeling of nothingness, like an empty brain but with a heightened sense of awareness. No space for thinking about your last conversation or whats for dinner tonight. Then the strangest thing happens when you come out of the flow. Usually near the end or when something doesn’t go to plan, your consciousness is suddenly upon you as the flow subsides. </p> 
 <p>After climbing most of the route like a robot that had been programmed to execute a sequence of moves, I suddenly run out of body tension and my heel pops. The realisation of reality hits me. I manage to hold the cut (not usual for me), and continue to the anchor, only to find the carabena had been screwed shut. Thank goodness, I had enough steam to undo it and clip the chain, letting out a primeval roar of success.</p> 
 <p>Trying hard things can be a journey of uncertainty that can make one question their self worth. It can make you feel like your wasting your time and could be trying other cool boulders or routes. It was definitely worth the sacrifice to climb one grade higher than I could before. Even if the grade is just a number. Even if the route plays to your strengths. If you know deep down that it challenged you mentally and physically then good work sunshine, maybe you are a little better.</p> 
  <p> All I know is I feel grateful: for the courage to try something that I might not have done. For the tenacity to keep trying it through the doubt and tribulations. And for the support of a great climbing partner who puts up with the trivial mood swings that a few percent of relative humidity can bring. </p>
